## Process

### Phase 1
1. **Sign Up**
   - Complete the [Agency 1 Signup Form](https://forms.office.com/e/QRE4GchecV) and provide your GitHub username and role preference.
2. **Orientation**
   - Attend the Agency 1 Introduction and Orientation calls, or watch the recordings, for an overview of expectations.
3. **Team Assignment**
   - You'll be assigned to a team based on your preferences. Teams aim to balance skills, so you might be placed in your 2nd or 3rd choice.
4. **Team Cohesion**
   - Organize a group meeting to plan sprints and other meetings.
5. **Course and Role Preparation**
   - Review the course content and research your assigned role.
6. **Project Familiarization**
   - Review the GitHub Repository’s [user stories](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/edu-gate/blob/develop/docs/Project-Requirements.md) to understand project requirements.

### Phase 2
1. **Design Planning**
   - Collaborate to depict the style guide and Hi-Fi prototype for mobile in Figma that adhered to QA engineer's design standards.
2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Hold weekly or biweekly sprint planning meetings for task assignment and to ensure design standards are met.
3. **Design Feedback**
   - Arrange a "show and tell" call with teachers to get feedback or approval on the design once completed.

### Phase 3
1. **Development Standards**
   - QA's set development standards for the team.
2. **Development Begins**
   - Provide feedback on each other’s work. Use Agile methodologies:
      - Daily Stand-Ups
         - What you did yesterday
         - Today's tasks (mention tickets)
         - Blockers (anything that is prohibiting you from completing your task)
      - Sprint Planning and Retrospectives
         - Reflect on what went well and what could improve.
3. **Client Showcase**
   - Once development is complete, schedule a call with the client for a project showcase.

### Phase 4
1. **Final Submission**
   - Submit the final product link to the client.
2. **Written Reflection**
   - Each member submits a written reflection on their experience, focusing on individual contributions.

## Requirements

Your contribution is assessed based on your written reflection and role responsibilities. Ensure you include:
- Screenshots of Figma contributions.
- Links to relevant GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- A link to the project board filtered by your GitHub username.
- Evidence of involvement in discussions (e.g., Discord, Teams).
- A reflection (~500-1000 words) on your process.

## Marking Criteria

### Scrum Master
- Uses Project Board tasks and breaks them down for the team according to Project Methodology standards.
- Manages the teams using Agile Methodology (leads sprint planning, sprint retrospective and daily-stand up)
- Reports to teachers.

### Quality Assurance Engineer
- Enforces coding standards and provides feedback to Pull Requests and Design work.
- Reviews Pull Requests and raises issues for bugs or unmet standards.

### Developer
- Understands or seeks out understanding and completes project tasks according to the project requirements
- Implements QA and peer review feedback
- Ensures code meets validity, accessibility, SEO, semantic, and responsive, DRY and best practice standards.

### Designer
- Works with QA on design accuracy, creates a mobile Hi-Fi prototype according to the style guide.
- Communicates with the client for design approval and makes necessary adjustments.

## Important Notes

- Within each role all work must be captured and it's progress depicted in the Project Board so that the team has transparency of who is working on which task and how the task is progressing.
- Development work needs to completed in a feature branch and a Pull Request opened into the `develop` branch as the base.
- Informative commit messages and Pull Request descripttions will benefit the entire team.
