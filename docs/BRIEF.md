## Project Brief: **Edugate** - Result Management System for High Schools in Nigeria

**Objective:**  
Edugate aims to streamline result management, user authentication, and administrative functions in high schools. This system will serve multiple user roles (Admin, Teacher, and Student) with unique access levels for each.

**Project Overview:**  
Edugate is a result management system tailored to meet the needs of high schools in Nigeria. Through a secure, user-friendly API, Edugate allows schools to manage and access student results, maintain user accounts, and verify data with role-specific permissions.

### Project Requirements:
The requirements for Edugate's frontend development focus on creating a user-friendly and efficient interface that fulfills the needs of students, teachers, and administrators. Here’s a breakdown of the essential frontend requirements:

---

### **1. Authentication & Authorization**
   - **Signup Page**: Allow users to create an account with email, username, and password. Implement validation and error handling.
   - **Login Page**: Enable existing users to log in securely, with feedback on incorrect credentials.
   - **Session Manaegment**: Implement session persistence so users stay logged in even when they refresh or navigate to other pages.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access to certain features based on user roles (e.g., students, teachers, administrators).

---

### **2. Navigation & User Interface**
   - **Responsive Navigation Bar**: Include links to Home, Results, Profile, and Logout, with dynamic items based on user roles.
   - **Sidebar (Admin & Teacher)**: Provide options for managing users, results, and schools with icons and expand/collapse functionality on smaller screens.
   - **Dashboard Layout**: 
      - **Students**: View profile info, recent results, and academic status.
      - **Teachers**: Access to results management tools.
      - **Admins**: Manage users, schools, and high-level data.

---

### **3. User Management**
   - **Profile Page**: Allow users to view and edit their profile information, including email, password, and photo.
   - **Admin User Controls**: Enable administrators to search, add, delete, and update user information.

---

### **4. Results Management**
   - **View Results**: Students can see their results by subject, including grades, comments, and overall performance.
   - **Add/Update Results** (Teachers): Teachers can enter and edit student results, with validation for input accuracy.
   - **Top-Level Results** (Teachers): A dashboard for teachers to access a summarized view of top-performing students or classes.

---

### **5. School Management (Admin)**
   - **School Data**: Allow admins to add and update school information, such as name, address, and contact details.

---

### **6. UI/UX Components and Design Consistency**
   - **Style Guide Compliance**: Use a defined color palette, typography, button styles, and spacing for visual consistency.
   - **Interactive Elements**: Implement clear feedback on interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) using hover effects, active states, and notifications.
   - **Modals and Alerts**:
      - **Confirmation Modals**: For critical actions like deletions.
      - **Notifications**: Success, error, and warning notifications to guide users during interactions.

---

### **7. Accessibility & Responsiveness**
   - **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layouts for all screens (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
   - **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure all elements are accessible with keyboard navigation and screen readers, with clear color contrast and font readability.

---

### **8. API Integration**
   - **Data Fetching & Error Handling**: Integrate with backend APIs to fetch, update, and delete data for users, results, and schools.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Enable real-time feedback where possible (e.g., upon saving or deleting data).
   - **Loading States**: Indicate data-loading processes on components that rely on backend responses.

---

### **9. Testing & Final Review**
   - **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
   - **User Testing**: Conduct testing sessions to identify usability issues and adjust the interface as needed.
   - **Final Review**: Check each page and component to ensure all elements align with the high-fidelity prototype and style guide.

---

### **Technical Stack and Tools**
   - **Framework/Library**: React, Vue, or another frontend framework.
   - **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (if preferred) for design consistency.
   - **Prototyping Tool**: Figma or Adobe XD for creating and sharing the UI designs.
   - **Version Control**: Git for collaborative code management.
